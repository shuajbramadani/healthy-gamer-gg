                <details>
                    <summary>What is coaching?</summary>
                    <p>Coaching is commonly defined as a process to help improve a person's performance. It is a
                        self-directed process that helps a person change in the way they wish to change. Coaching
                        builds awareness, empowers choice, and leads to change.
                        <br><br> HG Coaching will help you better understand how your mind works and provide a path
                        forward, so you can build the life you want and you achieve your goals. This program is not
                        meant to diagnose mental illness, prescribe medication, or be used for urgent health crises.
                        Coaching is not therapy nor a substitute for therapy, and coaches are not therapists.

                <details>
                    <summary>How is coaching different from therapy?</summary>
                    <p>While both coaching and therapy use evidence-based techniques and intentional dialogue, there
                        are important differences. Coaching is focused on "building" through planning,
                        introspection, and awareness, while therapy is more about "fixing" something through
                        clinical diagnoses, medication, and/or treatment. Coaching helps prioritize, set goals, and
                        understand the root of discontent or unhappiness. Therapy is intended to alleviate clinical
                        issues such as anxiety, depression, or trauma. You can learn more about the efficacy of
                        coaching here. Or, learn more about the differences between coaching and therapy here.</p>

                    <p>HG Coaches are peer coaches with similar personal experiences. They hold coaching
                        certifications from institutes like the ICF, the HG Institute, or other reputable

                    <summary>How does billing work?</summary>
                    <p>Coaching is billed monthly in installments of 4 sessions/month. Your payment method will
                        automatically be charged before your session(s) at the rate and frequency of your chosen
                        coaching package.
